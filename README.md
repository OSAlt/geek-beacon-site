# Contributions

NOTE:  We're happy to accept any contributions though keep in mind the 
initial site is a proof of concept and will probably be replaced by an 
 actual framework and a more ellaborate plan on what we're planning 
 to build. 
 
 Please join our mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/geekbeacon-webdev) if you wish to be more involved in the future of this site.  We'll probably create several spirals and the plan once we have one will be discussed/organized on there.
